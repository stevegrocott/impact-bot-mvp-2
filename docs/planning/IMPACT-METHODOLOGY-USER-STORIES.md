# Impact Measurement User Stories - Pitfall Prevention Focus
## Methodology-Driven Design to Prevent Common Measurement Traps

### Overview
These user stories are designed around preventing the 5 major pitfalls identified in impact measurement practice, while leveraging our IRIS+ dataset advantage to surface the right indicators at decision points.

**Core Philosophy: Foundation-First, Decision-Driven, Learning-Oriented**

**Anti-Pitfall Framework:**
1. **Foundation & Theory First** - Prevent jumping to metrics without context
2. **Decision-Driven Design** - "What decisions will this data inform?"
3. **Impact vs Activity Intelligence** - AI distinguishes outputs/outcomes/impacts
4. **Proxy Detection & Alternatives** - Flag proxy metrics, suggest direct measures
5. **Learning vs Proving Culture** - Support improvement over justification

**Proven Methodology Integration:**
- Three-lens approach: Quantitative + Qualitative + Expert Opinion
- Contribution vs Attribution honesty
- Minimum viable measurement design
- Progressive complexity based on organizational readiness
