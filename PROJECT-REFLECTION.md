# Impact Bot v2 Project Reflection
*Generated: June 19, 2025*

## üéØ Project Mission & Vision

**Core Mission**: Build a conversational AI platform that prevents the 5 major impact measurement pitfalls while guiding organizations through proven IRIS+ methodology.

**Key Pitfalls Being Addressed**:
1. Mistaking Activity for Impact (measuring outputs vs outcomes)
2. Proxy Metrics Masquerading as Data (attendance ‚â† engagement)  
3. Over-Engineering (building 47 unused KPIs)
4. Prove Not Improve Mindset (accountability over learning)
5. Chasing Certainty (claiming attribution vs contribution)
