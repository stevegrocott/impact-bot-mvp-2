## üéØ **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Impact Bot v2** is a conversational AI platform that guides organizations through proven impact measurement methodology while actively preventing the 5 major pitfalls that cause expensive measurement failures:

1. **Mistaking Activity for Impact** (measuring outputs instead of outcomes)
2. **Proxy Metrics Masquerading as Data** (using attendance as proxy for engagement)
3. **Over-Engineering** (building 47 KPIs that nobody uses)
4. **Prove Not Improve Mindset** (accountability over learning)
5. **Chasing Certainty** (claiming attribution instead of contribution)
