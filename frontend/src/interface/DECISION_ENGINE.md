# Impact Bot Decision Support Engine
*Context-Aware Recommendation System for Project Decisions*

## ðŸ§  Decision Framework

### Core Decision Types

#### 1. User Experience Decisions
```typescript
interface UXDecisionContext {
  user_feedback: UserFeedback[];
  usage_patterns: BehaviorAnalytics;
  methodology_requirements: MethodologyRule[];
  technical_constraints: TechnicalConstraint[];
}

class UXDecisionEngine {
  evaluateFeatureRequest(
    request: string,
    context: UXDecisionContext
  ): DecisionRecommendation {
    
    // Example: "Should we simplify the personality selection?"
    if (request.includes("simplify personality")) {
      return {
        recommendation: "ENHANCE_RATHER_THAN_SIMPLIFY",
        reasoning: [
          "73% of users complete personality selection successfully",
          "Confusion stems from unclear value propositions, not complexity",
          "Personality choice drives 40% improvement in conversation engagement"
        ],
        suggested_action: "Add preview conversations and 'change anytime' reassurance",
        priority: "medium",
        effort_estimate: "2-3 days",
        success_metrics: ["Completion rate >85%", "User satisfaction >4.2/5"]
      };
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Technical Architecture Decisions
```typescript
interface TechnicalDecisionContext {
  current_architecture: SystemArchitecture;
  performance_requirements: PerformanceTarget[];
  scalability_needs: ScalabilityRequirement[];
  maintenance_constraints: MaintenanceConstraint[];
}

class TechnicalDecisionEngine {
  evaluateArchitecturalChoice(
    choice: string,
    context: TechnicalDecisionContext
  ): ArchitecturalRecommendation {
    
    // Example: "Should we use WebSockets for real-time collaboration?"
    if (choice.includes("WebSocket") && choice.includes("collaboration")) {
      return {
        recommendation: "IMPLEMENT_IN_PHASE_2",
        reasoning: [
          "73% of current users are single-person organizations",
          "Collaboration is valuable but not immediately critical",
          "WebSocket complexity should come after core UX is stable"
        ],
        suggested_approach: "Build collaboration hooks in Phase 1, implement WebSocket in Phase 2",
        technical_debt_impact: "low",
        user_impact: "Phase 1: none, Phase 2: high for team users"
      };
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Methodology Compliance Decisions
```typescript
interface MethodologyDecisionContext {
  foundation_first_rules: FoundationRule[];
  pitfall_prevention_requirements: PitfallRule[];
  user_agency_balance: AgencyRequirement[];
  compliance_standards: ComplianceStandard[];
}

class MethodologyDecisionEngine {
  evaluateComplianceChoice(
    choice: string,
    context: MethodologyDecisionContext
  ): ComplianceRecommendation {
    
    // Example: "Should we allow users to skip theory of change for testing?"
    if (choice.includes("skip theory") && choice.includes("testing")) {
      return {
        recommendation: "CONTROLLED_BYPASS_WITH_SAFEGUARDS",
        reasoning: [
          "Foundation-first is core to preventing pitfalls",
          "Demo/testing needs are legitimate",
          "Bypass must maintain methodology education"
        ],
        suggested_implementation: {
          demo_mode: "Clear 'demo only' labeling with limitations explained",
          admin_override: "Internal testing with full feature access",
          user_education: "Explain why foundation-first prevents expensive mistakes"
        },
        compliance_risk: "low with proper safeguards",
        user_experience_impact: "positive for demos, neutral for core users"
      };
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Example Decision Support Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Feature Prioritization
```yaml
Question: "Should we build advanced analytics or collaborative features first?"

Context_Analysis:
  current_user_base: "73% single-person organizations, 27% teams"
  user_feedback: "Power users requesting analytics, teams requesting collaboration"
  technical_capacity: "2 developers, 4-week sprint capacity"
  methodology_requirements: "Analytics supports decision-mapping, collaboration supports stakeholder buy-in"

Decision_Support_Output:
  recommendation: "BUILD_ANALYTICS_FIRST"
  reasoning:
    - "Analytics directly supports foundation-first methodology (decision mapping)"
    - "73% of users are single-person, analytics has broader impact"
    - "Collaboration features complex, analytics can be delivered incrementally"
    - "Analytics creates data for future collaboration features"
  
  implementation_approach:
    phase_1: "Basic foundation readiness analytics (2 weeks)"
    phase_2: "Decision outcome tracking (2 weeks)"  
    phase_3: "Collaborative analytics review (future sprint)"
  
  success_metrics:
    - "Foundation completion rate increases >10%"
    - "Decision mapping adoption >60%"
    - "User engagement with analytics >40%"
  
  risk_mitigation:
    - "Survey team users to validate collaboration can wait"
    - "Build collaboration hooks in analytics design"
    - "Plan collaboration features for immediate next sprint"
```

### Scenario 2: User Experience Optimization
```yaml
Question: "Users say the AI personality differences aren't clear enough"

Context_Analysis:
  completion_rates: "Coach: 85%, Advisor: 78%, Analyst: 72%"
  user_feedback: "Personalities feel similar in actual conversation"
  usage_patterns: "Most users stick with first choice, 15% switch personalities"
  methodology_impact: "Personality affects foundation completion quality"

Decision_Support_Output:
  recommendation: "ENHANCE_PERSONALITY_DISTINCTIVENESS"
  reasoning:
    - "Completion rate differences suggest personalities do matter"
    - "Low switching rate indicates initial choice is important"
    - "Quality impact justifies investment in distinctiveness"
  
  specific_improvements:
    1. "Add personality preview conversations (3 days)"
    2. "Enhance language pattern differences (2 days)"
    3. "Create personality-specific recommendation logic (4 days)"
    4. "Add 'try different personality' suggestions (1 day)"
  
  testing_approach:
    - "A/B test enhanced vs current personalities"
    - "Measure completion rates and user satisfaction"
    - "Track personality switching patterns"
  
  expected_outcomes:
    - "Personality selection confidence increases"
    - "Overall completion rates improve 5-8%"
    - "User satisfaction with AI interactions improves"
```
