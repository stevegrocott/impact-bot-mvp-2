# Handoff Notes for scullers68

## Repository Setup Instructions

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub named 'impact-bot-mvp-2'
# Make it public or private as needed
# DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
```

### 2. Push Local Repository
```bash
# From the project directory (/Users/shinytrap/projects/impact-bot-mvp-2)
git remote add origin https://github.com/scullers68/impact-bot-mvp-2.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Push
- Check that all files are visible on GitHub
- Verify the README.md displays correctly
- Ensure all documentation in `/docs/planning/` is accessible

## Project State Summary

### âœ… What's Complete
- **Technical Foundation**: PostgreSQL + pgvector, JWT auth, Anthropic integration
- **Basic Features**: Conversation management, indicator selection workflow
- **Documentation**: Complete methodology-driven approach with pitfall prevention focus
- **Architecture**: Hybrid vector + structured content for optimal IRIS+ discovery

### ðŸš§ What's Needed for Release 1
1. **Theory of Change Capture** (flexible upload OR guided creation)
2. **Phase-Gated Workflow** (prevent metrics without foundation)
3. **Activity vs Impact Intelligence** (AI warnings for output measures)
4. **Proxy Detection System** (identify and suggest alternatives)
5. **User Behavior Analytics** (critical for learning from free distribution)

### ðŸ“‹ Critical Implementation Notes

#### Foundation-First is Non-Negotiable
- Users MUST complete theory of change before accessing indicators
- This prevents the #1 pitfall: "jumping to metrics without context"
- Implement flexible capture: upload existing OR guided creation

#### AI Must Actively Prevent Pitfalls
- Real-time warnings, not just educational content
- "This measures activity, not impact" - with outcome alternatives
- "This is a proxy for X" - with direct measurement suggestions

#### Decision-Driven Design
- Always ask "What decisions will this data inform?"
- Build minimum viable measurement systems
- Prevent over-engineering (the "47 KPIs nobody uses" problem)

#### Learning Analytics are Critical
- We're distributing free to learn quickly
- Track every user interaction for optimization
- Focus on: pathway completion, warning effectiveness, discovery patterns

## Remember the Mission

We're not building another measurement platform. We're building a **pitfall prevention system** that helps organizations avoid expensive, demoralizing measurement mistakes while discovering the right indicators for their specific context and decisions.

Every feature should answer: "Does this prevent a measurement pitfall?"

Good luck! The foundation is solid - now let's prevent those pitfalls! ðŸš€
