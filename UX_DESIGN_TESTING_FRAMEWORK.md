## 🧠 **UX DESIGN FOUNDATION**

### **Target User Personas & Context**
> **🚨 CRITICAL ADDITION**: See `/ROLE_BASED_UX_DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md` for comprehensive role-specific UX design from world-class UI/UX designer perspective.

**Six Distinct User Roles with Unique Contexts:**
- **Super Admin**: Platform steward managing cross-organizational oversight
- **Organization Admin**: Executive leader balancing impact strategy with operations  
- **Impact Manager**: M&E Director coordinating teams and methodology
- **Impact Analyst**: Hands-on practitioner implementing measurement systems
